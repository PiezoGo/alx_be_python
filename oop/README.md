## Overview
Today’s focus was on mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python — particularly class design, inheritance, polymorphism, and clean output formatting.  
Additionally, I explored how **GitHub notifications and public activity visibility** work to understand how my work is displayed to others.

## What I Worked On
### 1. Library Management System (OOP Practice)
- Implemented a `Book`, `EBook`, and `PrintBook` class demonstrating **inheritance** and **method overriding**.
- Designed a `Library` class to store and list books using OOP principles.
- Enhanced the system to format output neatly using `__str__()` methods and `isinstance()` checks.

#### Concepts Practiced
- Encapsulation 
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism (handling multiple object types under a common interface)
- Clean object printing with `__str__`
